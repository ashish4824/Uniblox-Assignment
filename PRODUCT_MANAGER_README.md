# Product Manager Assignment

##  Assignment Overview

This is a Product Management take-home assignment focused on defining and prioritizing AI-powered features for a document intelligence platform. The assignment tests product thinking, prioritization skills, technical feasibility assessment, and communication abilities.

##  Scenario

You are a Product Manager at a fast-growing AI company building next-generation productivity tools. Your team has developed an AI-powered document intelligence platform with a new LLM and reasoning engine capable of:

1. **Extracting structured data** from unstructured documents (emails, PDFs, contracts, reports)
2. **AI-driven summarization** and recommendations based on extracted insights
3. **Automated decision-making** (risk assessment, approvals, prioritization)

Your task is to transform this AI innovation into a real product feature that delivers user value.

- What are their goals and challenges?
- How do they currently handle this problem?
- What are their pain points with current solutions?

#### 3. Proposed Solution
- How does the AI-powered feature work?
- How does it integrate into the platform?
- What is the user experience flow?
- What makes this solution better than alternatives?

#### 4. Key Functional Requirements
Must-have functionalities (use bullet points or user stories):
- As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]
- Core features and capabilities
- Integration requirements
- Performance requirements

#### 5. Success Metrics
How will we measure impact?
- Primary metrics (North Star metric)
- Secondary metrics
- Counter metrics (what could go wrong)
- Leading indicators vs lagging indicators

#### 6. Potential Risks & Mitigations
- Technical risks and solutions
- Business risks and mitigations
- User adoption risks
